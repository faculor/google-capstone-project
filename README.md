# **Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone Project**

## **Salifort Motors HR Department**

This is my capstone project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics course from Google and Coursera. The project includes an analysis  of a dataset and the construction of predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large industrial firm.

### Business scenario and problem

The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, and now they need to extract useful insights from it. They want data-driven in order to answer the following question: whatâ€™s likely to make the employee leave the company?

The goals set to accomplish this project are:
 - Analyze the data collected by the HR department
 - Build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

The logic behind the project is that if the resignation of employees can be predicted, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
